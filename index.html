<h2>Akan Naming Ceremony</h2>
<p>The Akan people of Ghana name a newborn child on the eighth day after they’re born. 
    The new born child is usually named after relatives (dead or alive), or the circumstances 
    surrounding his or her birth. The Akan traditionally leave the naming ceremony until the 
    eighth day as a way to confirm that the child has come to stay and will not be returning to back to
    the world of the ancestors. It’s also common for the Akan to name a child after the day 
    of the week that they were born.You could also find your equivalent akan name depending on the day 
    of the week you were born!! <em>Lets give it a try.</em> </p>
